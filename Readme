##Introduction
This project is a simulation of an exploring method deisgned for
multi-target in teleport-point map.The strategy is based on Dijkstra algorithm and A-star algorithm aiming
to generate the optimal path reaching all the target nodes. There are 3 kinds of different maps tested
as the output results, with elements like obstacles, freespace, mountain, river and road. Also, the 
weight parameter w was added to modify local planner to weight A-star algorithm as part of the test. In the final, 
this algorithm was compared with another two methods to show its capabilities.

##Main result file
To check all the output plots, you could just run the main_result.m file. The briefly explanations are listed as below.
```python
figure(1)%small_map
Test_main(21,10);

figure(2)%medium map
Test_main(41,15);

figure(3)%large_map
Test_main(61,20);
```

```python

figure(4)%weight_large_map
Test_main_weight(61,20);
```

```python
%12 plots for comparison with another methods
Test_Plot_Main_Large();
Test_Plot_Main_Medium();
Test_Plot_Main_Small();

%Plots with increasing target number
Test_increasingnumber_plot();

```
